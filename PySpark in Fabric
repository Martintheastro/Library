    .withColumnRenamed('old name', 'new name')\

    .withColumn("Extract_Timestamp",to_date(current_timestamp())) # changing format of Extract_Timestamp to Date only

# when new column has to be renamed just add .withColumnRenamed('old name', 'new name')\, last row of this df. statement cant have "\"

 

# Create spark dataframe to be able to save it as delta table in lakehouse:

# spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(df)

# display(spark_df)

 

# Save DataFrame as append to Delta Lake table in the Tables section of the default Lakehouse, append new records
